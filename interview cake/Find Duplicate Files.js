/*
 * You left your computer unlocked and your friend decided to troll you by copying a lot of your files to random spots all over your file system.
 *
 * Even worse, she saved the duplicate files with random,
 * embarrassing names ("this_is_like_a_digital_wedgie.txt" was clever, I'll give her that).
 *
 * Write a function that returns an array of all the duplicate files. We'll check them by hand before actually deleting them,
 * since programmatically deleting files is really scary. To help us confirm that two files are actually duplicates, return an array of arrays where:
 *
 * the first item is the duplicate file
 * the second item is the original file
